Sunday, the day before my internship started, I got a text from Andreas (CEO of madewithlove) asking me if I wanted to join him monday evening on his weekly trip to Rotterdam. Of course I wanted to!

>Since pictures can tell you more than a boring block of text, I will show you pictures … a lot of them.

The first day upon my arrival I immediately got a sketchbook from Andreas, telling me it would come in handy the next weeks. And it did!
After he briefed me about a project he was thinking about for some time and how I got to design and think about the whole User Interface, I did use the sketchbook a lot! This little project would become something I got to work on the coming six weeks.

*‘It’s not how good you are, it’s how good you want to be.’* by Paul Arden. This book, and two others, considered as the Bible of madewithlove to Andreas, which is why he wanted me to read them (and I did!) so I could understand what his vision behind madewithlove and it’s team is. I even got to keep Paul Arden’s book, which means a lot since it’s really a pleasant book to read!

**Around 7.30pm,** Andreas would pick me up at my place and we would drive to Rotterdam. When driving he told me about how the Internet works and how simple it actually is, consisting of just text-files. Not only this, but also about the dangers of the Internet and how simple it is to find or fetch personal data. He learned me countless things about servers, for example how a browser finds a webpage or computer you’ve been looking for in this huge pile of websites all over the world.
>Andreas even told me about once betting his mom he could transfer €100 from his mom’s account to his own without her noticing.
>Two weeks later he was €100 richer.

When arriving at the CitizenM hotel in Rotterdam, which was a really nice hotel bye the way, Andreas showed me how to ‘talk’ to a server. While having a (free!) drink we talked a little more about the company, how it works and how important the teamspirit is at madewithlove.

The next day Andreas got up Early (6am) to run for an hour while I was still snoring. At 8.30am we would drive to the port where Awkward was situated, a digital design company working together with madewithlove on an app called Addapp.

Awkward’s place was really nice. It was cosy, although looking pretty modern and stacked with fun people. Andreas and I met with Stijn (photo below) from Awkward and while they were discussion some things, I was still amazed and taking pictures of their interior.

Not only do they make beautiful digital stuff, the also make the best coffee and weirdest lunch with fermented beans who tasted really … *strong* I guess.

>“Do the Belgians want coffee?!” was yelled numerous times throughout the day.

The day ended at 3 pm when I had worked on a landing page for Addapp and got to learn how to work with Sketch, a designing tool which is particularly useful when designing for mobile devices for example, more useful than Adobe Illustrator for example, although Adobe Illustrator comes in handy with a lot of other things. After saying goodbye to ‘the Dutchmen’ we headed home.

**The rest of the week** I worked on my project of which Andreas and I did a pitch on to Nico, CEO of Slim Beleggen and a good friend of Andreas. Nico seemed like a really nice, driven guy, actually everyone I met at madewithlove so far.
To end this weeks post I decided to post some photos of the building and people at madewithlove.

Cheers!
